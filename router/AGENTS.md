# Router Guidelines

- When introducing new routing rules or signals, run comparative backtests such as `python3 scripts/run_compare.py` to measure performance shifts.
- Summarize routing changes and key metrics in Japanese for reporting, while keeping code-level notes in English.
- Coordinate router updates with strategy definitions in [../strategies](../strategies) and reference [../docs/task_backlog.md](../docs/task_backlog.md) for current objectives.
