# Observability Expansion Plan

This placeholder outlines the desired evolution of telemetry and dashboards that support trading and research workflows.

## Objectives
- Consolidate KPI definitions (EV trends, slippage projections, win-rate LCB, turnover) across CLI outputs and dashboards.
- Ensure notebook- and BI-based views align with operational alerting requirements.
- Document dependencies on data pipelines, storage, and access controls.

## Current Coverage
- `docs/observability_dashboard.md` captures the existing dashboard pipeline, but alignment with roadmap milestones is pending.
- Runtime snapshots and webhook alerts cover select metrics; broader SLA tracking remains undocumented.

## Risks & Considerations
- Dashboard refresh cadence versus data ingestion latency tolerances.
- Versioning and reproducibility of dashboard artifacts for audits.
- Sandbox or offline review paths when production credentials are unavailable.

## Action Items
- [ ] Inventory current telemetry sources and responsible owners.
- [ ] Describe the desired BI/Notebook integration architecture.
- [ ] Define alert thresholds and escalation paths for each KPI.
- [ ] Add cross-references to docs/task_backlog.md for observability workstreams.

> **TODO**: Replace this scaffold with detailed plans, diagrams, and validation checklists.
