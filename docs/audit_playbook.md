# Audit & Compliance Playbook

This document will codify how artifacts and operational changes are reviewed, approved, and preserved for compliance.

## Purpose
- Establish a repeatable process for verifying artifact integrity (e.g., hashes, signatures, immutable storage).
- Clarify required approvals and documentation for production changes.
- Provide quick-reference checklists for internal or external audits.
- Map roadmap expectations to concrete compliance deliverables.

## Current Gaps
- Artifact ledger (ADR-020) procedures are not yet summarised for day-to-day operators.
- Evidence retention timelines and storage policies are undefined.
- Links to relevant ADRs, runbooks, and ticketing systems remain to be added.
- Operational owners for compliance reviews have not been assigned.

## Planned Sections
1. **Governance Roles** — Responsibilities for approvers, reviewers, and operators.
2. **Artifact Ledger Workflow** — How to register, verify, and rotate artifacts.
3. **Change Management** — Required records for code, configuration, and dataset updates.
4. **Audit Preparation Checklist** — Documents, logs, and metrics to export ahead of reviews.
5. **Incident & Exception Handling** — Escalation paths when audit findings require remediation.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Draft role definitions and approval matrices.
- [ ] Document end-to-end artifact ledger procedures with examples.
- [ ] Specify evidence retention SLAs and storage locations.
- [ ] Integrate escalation contacts and communication templates.
- [ ] Align ledger operations with [docs/task_backlog.md#継続タスク--保守](task_backlog.md#継続タスク--保守) tracking items.
- [ ] Add audit rehearse/runbook guidance linked from docs/development_roadmap.md.

> **TODO**: Populate each section with authoritative guidance and link to supporting ADRs/runbooks.
