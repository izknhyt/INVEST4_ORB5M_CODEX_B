# Strategies Guidelines

- Document new signals or logic adjustments in English within the code and design notes, while preparing Japanese summaries for stakeholders.
- Validate behavior through comparative runs (`python3 scripts/run_compare.py` or similar) and capture key deltas for review.
- Keep strategy implementations consistent with configuration manifests in [../configs/strategies](../configs/strategies) and planned work in [../docs/task_backlog.md](../docs/task_backlog.md).
